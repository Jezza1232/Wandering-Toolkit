🔧 Refined Description of Your Menu System

This project is a self‑initializing operations menu designed to handle all the heavy lifting automatically.

When launched for the first time, the menu performs its own environment setup:

- Installs WinGet if missing
- Downloads SteamCMD and places it in C:\steamcmd\
- Installs PowerShell 7
- Verifies all required directories and dependencies
Only after the environment is fully prepared does the main menu appear.

user starts something like -menu.bat? menu.exe?

📁 Modular Folder Architecture

The system is built around a clean, predictable directory structure that keeps every component isolated and easy to update:
- tools\
Contains all operational tools.
Each tool lives in its own subfolder for clarity and modularity.
Example:
- tools\backup-tool\
- tools\server-maintenance\
- tools\log-parser\
- data\

Stores all datasets, configs, and reference material.

Organized into purpose‑specific subdirectories:

- data\main\ — core data
- data\dev-notes\ — development notes, drafts, planning
- data\rcon\ — RCON configs, credentials, presets
- data\steamcmd-information\steamcmd\ — SteamCMD metadata
- data\steamcmd-information\helpful-info\ — guides, cheat sheets, reference files

This structure ensures everything is easy to find, easy to maintain, and easy to extend.
New tools or datasets can be added simply by dropping them into the correct folder.

✨ A More Cinematic Version (if you want it for your project docs)

“On first breath, the Menu forges its own tools.”
It installs WinGet, summons SteamCMD into C:\steamcmd\, and upgrades itself to PowerShell 7.
Only once the foundations are laid does the Menu reveal its true form.

Its architecture is deliberately modular:

- Tools live in their own chambers, each isolated for clarity and future expansion.
- Knowledge is stored in the Data Archives, sorted into main records, developer notes, RCON keys, and SteamCMD lore.

Everything is where it should be. Everything is ready for growth.
